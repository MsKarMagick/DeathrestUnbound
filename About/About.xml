        This mod removes the permanent binding mechanic from Deathrest Caskets, allowing pawns to use them even if they were previously used by a different pawn.
        No more having 10 different deathrest areas, or rebuilding a casket every time someone needs to use it.

        Features:
        - Lets players manually unbind pawns from Deathrest Caskets.

        Compatibility:
        - Tested on RimWorld version 1.5.
        - Compatible with Vanilla Sanguophages Expanded as it doesn't edit the base

        Incompatibilities:
        - Other mods that do the same. If you find one that does? It probably does it better than this, use that instead. But I couldn't find any mod like this, hence why I'm publishing my first mod.

        Load Order:
        - Ensure this mod is loaded after Biotech Harmony.

        Special Thanks:
        - To the modders who've documented their work to make it easier on new modders.
        - Harmony devs for making this way easier than it otherwise would have been, and honestly just possible, period.
        - ChatGPT for enduring the onslaught of verbal abuse I sent its way while forcing it to try to remember things I sent 1500 messages ago.
